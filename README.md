# esx_trento_weaponmaster
A very simple modification of the very common (and nowadays old) EasyWeapon and WeaponsOnBack scripts. This script combines both of them and adds extra features like the ability to change aim styles, change holster positions, tint parachute color or parachute smoke.

This is just the version that was used in a Roleplay server in 2021. It might not work on current ESX.
